Does Quizlet Spell for you.

You have to press space to answer the questions because Quizlet does not update its input variable until it detects an input, and this is made to not require any software to be installed on the computer (which is why this doesn't use Selenium). It uses some code from Snozone's (or something like that) just for the enter key I believe.
